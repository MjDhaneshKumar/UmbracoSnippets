Once the tinyMceConfig.config file has changed a little bit, I have done some changes on the commands code, as per the plugins available in :

Text Color Plugin which provides specific And also colorpicker which enables users to pick any color they want

Fullpage which provides multiple features such as font size and font family

Follow the below steps to add those features is :

Go to tinyMceConfig.config file, and between the commands tag add the below code :
 <command alias="forecolor" name="Change Color" mode="Selection" />
 <command alias="fontselect" name="Change Font Family" mode="Selection" />
 <command alias="fontsizeselect" name="Change Font Size" mode="Selection" />
Add the below code between plugins tag
<plugin>textcolor</plugin>
<plugin>colorpicker</plugin>
<plugin>fullpage</plugin>
Now from Umbraco - settings - datatypes - richtext editor, add the new properties, and do the same to the richtext editor property from its Document type
